Greetings Fellow Programmer,

If you have any questions on running or setting up this game, send me an email at jethrohchan@gmail.com.

It is written in Assembly, some of the commands are explained in the program itself. One can find comments in lines beginning with ";". The code can be run on the CUSP emulator.

Thanks for visiting,

Jethro Chan
